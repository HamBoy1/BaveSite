	<p style="font-family: bookman; font-size: 13pt">Before settling in the Grapevine area thousands
	of years ago, Mr. Benning was a great voyaging hero. He accomplished many tasks for the sake of
	peace and justice. A few of these legendary tasks are listed below.</p>

	<h3>Legacy Story</h3>
	<p style="font-family: bookman; font-size: 13pt">There was once a vile king who ruled from a 
	mountain top. There were two villages over which he ruled, one on the East side of the mountain
	and one of the West side. He controlled the water supply on the top of the mountain in such a way 
	that when one village displeased him, he would direct the water toward the other one. In this way, 
	at any one time, one village would be flourishing and the other starving. When Bavid learned of the 
	conditions of these two villages, he was appalled. In order to fix the situation, he tied the North
	side of the mountain to his mighty horse, Legacy, and he took hold of a rope tied to the South side
	of the mountain. At his signal, he and Legacy pulled in opposite directions and tore the mountain
	in two. The river at the top of the mountain crashed down between the two halves, and thus ran 
	between both of the villages. However, as the king on the top of the mountain felt his palace
	crumbling, he took a last act of revenge and threw his sceptre at Legacy before he fell to his
	death. The sceptre struck Legacy from such a great height that the horse died. Bavid mourned the
	death of his trusty horse for three days, and on the third day he used his great power to encase
	the body of his horse in the stone from the mountain. The stone horse remains a fixture at GHS to
	this day. </p>

	<h3>Railroad Story</h3>
	<p style="font-family: bookman; font-size: 13pt">
	There was near a village a healing spring. Anyone who drank from the spring would find all their
	ailments cured. Because it was so effective, it was the only source of medical care for the people 
	of the village, so they never developed other forms of medicine. The only trouble was that some medical
	emergencies were too urgent to for the long journey to the spring, so people would die along the way.
	They tried to bottle the restorative spring water, but found that it lost its power when it was not
	drunk directly from the source. What they needed was a way to reach the spring faster, but even their
	swiftest horses were not fast enough, and the journey by horseback tended to jostle the patient to the
	point of worsening their condition. Mr. Benning heard of the plight of these people, and set out to
	devise a faster and smoother method of travelling from the village to the spring. He decided to build
	rails, but needed a material that would allow for a fast and smooth ride. For this, he drew down
	moonlight and hammered it into two long rails. Once the rails were in place, he needed a contraption
	for riding along the rails. For this he took a carriage and placed its wheels on the rails. The people
	were critical of his method, saying that this carriage would still have to be drawn by horses, so the
	problem wouldn't be solved. Bavid ignored their doubts and drew down rays from the Sun and trapped them
	under the carriage. In this way, the power of the Sun propelled the carriage down the smooth tracks of
	moonlight, and the people were able to safely travel to the spring far faster than any horse could run.

	<h3>Meteor Story</h3>
	<p style="font-family: bookman; font-size: 13pt">
	For a time, Bave was travelling alone and taking some "me time." He disguised himself as a regular
	person and avoided conflict. During this time of rest, he did not hear the news of a powerful demon
	coming through space to cause chaos on Earth. The arrival of this demon was preceded by three destructive
`	events. The first was rains of fire. Bave did not know the cause of the firey rains, but wanted to
	protect people while keeping his identity hidden. For this, he planned to spread his great cloak over
	all the towns to shield them from the rains. However, to open his cloak would revealed himself to all
	the people, so he knew he would not be able to hide under the cloak with them. Instead he threw
	the cloak out over them and remained in the rain, dodging each firey drop with his great speed and
	agility. After the rains, his cloak was thoroughly burnt, but he wore it anyway to preserve his
	disguise. The second event was a terrible flood. Bavid lifted the towns over his head so that the
	floods couldn't reach them, but as the water swirled at his legs it tore away his damaged cloak. To
	remain hidden, Bave knelt so that the water was over his head hiding his face, but his arms still
	held the towns up out of the floods. After the floods drained away and he had set the towns down,
	Bave didn't have a cloak to disguise himself, so he had to hide behind his shield. The final event
	was the eruption of a massive volcano. As the clouds of ash approached the towns, Bavid leaped between
	the towns and the volcano and blocked the ash with his great shield. It rolled back but more was still
	coming, and the demon was now arriving. It was hurtling through space as a meteor and had just reached
	Earth's atmosphere. Bave was going to fight away the demon, but realized that he would have to leave his
	shield to keep the ash from the towns. Bavid finally gave up keeping his disguise, stuck the shield
	into the ground, and leapt into the sky. He met the demon in the sky, and with one mighty strike, he
	destroyed the demon and sent it hurtling away in pieces. The people were so grateful to Bave that he
	decided to never hide his identity from them again.
